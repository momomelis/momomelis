## About

I work at the intersection of:
**Femtech** · **DeFi** · **Music Production** · **Mythological Storytelling**

## Currently Building

### 🍓 Strawberry Protocol
Smart period underwear with embedded sensor technology and real-time biometric data collection —
a distributed health data infrastructure designed for individual sovereignty and collective care.

- Embedded sensors: cycle tracking, temperature, pH, hormonal markers
- Decentralized data storage with user-controlled privacy layers
- Web3 health wallet interoperability
- Sonic feedback systems synced to physiological state

### 🔗 NFT Collection × DAO Governance
An NFT-based governance layer enabling menstrual sovereignty. Holders participate in protocol
decisions, resource allocation, and community stewardship through on-chain voting.

- Community-led feature prioritization via `Snapshot.org`
- Multi-sig treasury management
- Quadratic voting to prevent whale dominance
- Transparent on-chain proposals

### 🎛️ Sonic Rituals
Algorithmic soundscapes mapped to menstrual cycle phases — biohacking meets mythological narrative.

- Real-time audio generation from sensor data
- Cycle-phase-specific ambient compositions
- Ritualistic ceremony design
- Haptic feedback integration

### ⚖️ Cross-Chain Infrastructure
Multi-chain deployment across Ethereum and Solana for accessibility, gas efficiency, and resilience.

- Ethereum: primary governance and token contracts (Solidity + Hardhat + OpenZeppelin)
- Solana: low-cost transactions via Solana Program Library
- Cross-chain bridging (LayerZero / Wormhole)
- Unified liquidity pools and treasury management
