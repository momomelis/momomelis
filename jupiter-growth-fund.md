BIGGEST ANNOUNCEMENT IN JUPITER HISTORY

We're redirecting $70M from token buybacks to ecosystem growth.

This will 10x Jupiter over the next 12 months.

Here's everything you need to know

---

**1/ THE PROBLEM**

Last year we spent $70M on token buybacks.

The result?
- Price: Minimal impact
- Users: No change
- Volume: No change
- TVL: No change

$70M spent. Nothing to show for it.

That changes TODAY.

---

**2/ THE BIG SHIFT**

We're stopping buybacks immediately and deploying that $70M into 10 high-impact growth programs.

Total budget: $70,000,000
Timeline: 24 months
Goal: 10x users, 5x volume, dominant market position

This is Jupiter's growth fund.

---

**3/ WHY THIS WORKS**

Buybacks are defensive. They don't create value.

Growth programs are offensive. They create:
- More users
- More volume
- More builders
- More integrations
- More utility for JUP

Real demand >> artificial scarcity

---

**4/ THE 10 PROGRAMS**

Here's where the $70M is going:

Tier 1: Immediate Impact ($28M)
- Liquidity Mining 2.0: $15M
- Trading Rewards: $8M
- Referrals: $5M

Tier 2: Ecosystem ($24.5M)
- Dev Grants: $10M
- Partnerships: $7.5M
- Perps Growth: $7M

---

**5/ (continued)**

Tier 3: Innovation ($10.5M)
- Mobile App: $5M
- Cross-Chain: $3M
- R&D: $2.5M

Tier 4: Reserve ($7M)
- Strategic flexibility

Each program has clear metrics and ROI tracking.

Full transparency.

---

**6/ PROGRAM 1: LIQUIDITY MINING 2.0**

$15M over 6 months to supercharge liquidity.

The best pools with the deepest liquidity.

Lock your LP tokens, earn JUP rewards:
- No lock: Base APR
- 30 days: 1.2x rewards
- 90 days: 1.5x rewards
- 180 days: 2.0x rewards

JUP/USDC up to 90% APR

---

**7/ Anti-mercenary design:**

- 30% rewards immediate
- 70% vest over 90 days
- 10% early exit penalty → redistributed to stayers
- Gradual taper (not cliff)

We want long-term LPs, not mercenaries.

Target: $750M TVL (5x current)

---

**8/ PROGRAM 2: TRADING REWARDS**

$8M over 12 months to reward active traders.

4 tiers based on monthly volume:
- Bronze (>$10k): 10% fee rebate
- Silver (>$100k): 20% rebate
- Gold (>$500k): 30% rebate
- Platinum (>$2M): 40% rebate

Plus monthly JUP bonuses!

---

**9/ But here's the killer feature:**

STAKE JUP → GET FEE DISCOUNTS

- Stake 1k JUP = 10% discount
- Stake 10k JUP = 25% discount
- Stake 100k JUP = 50% discount
- Stake 1M JUP = 75% discount

This creates REAL demand for JUP tokens.

Not buybacks. Utility.

---

**10/ PROGRAM 3: REFERRAL PROGRAM**

$5M to make Jupiter viral.

Refer friends, earn JUP:
- 5 JUP per successful referral
- 10% of their trading fees (lifetime!)
- Multipliers for milestones
- Public leaderboard

Top referrer last month: 2,847 referrals, earned 14,235 JUP

---

**11/ PROGRAM 4: DEVELOPER GRANTS**

$10M over 24 months for ecosystem projects.

We're funding:
- SDK integrations (Telegram bots, portfolio trackers)
- DeFi protocols (leverage, yield, options)
- Analytics tools
- Education content
- Infrastructure

Grant sizes: $1k - $200k

**20/ THE TARGETS (12 months)**

- TVL: $150M → $750M (5x)
- Revenue: $100k/day → $500k/day (5x)

---

**21/ THE ROI COMPARISON**

$70M Buyback Program:
- Price impact: Minimal
- New users: 0
- New volume: 0
- Strategic value: None
- ROI: 0.05x

- Volume added: $2B
- New users: 450k
- Ecosystem: Dominant
- ROI: 8-12x

---

**22/ FULL TRANSPARENCY**

### Blog Post Announcement

Published on jup.ag/blog

#### Jupiter Growth Fund: $70M to 10x the Ecosystem

**TL;DR:** We're stopping token buybacks and deploying $70M into 10 high-impact growth programs over 24 months. Goal: 10x users, 5x volume, dominant market position.

##### Why We're Doing This

In 2024, we spent approximately $70M on token buybacks. The results were clear: minimal price impact, no user growth, no volume increase. Buybacks proved to be an ineffective use of capital.

Meanwhile, we watched other protocols succeed through growth programs:
- Uniswap's liquidity mining created the dominant DEX
- Compound's COMP distribution made them the DeFi leader
- Aave's ecosystem grants built an unstoppable protocol

The lesson: **Growth creates sustainable value. Buybacks create temporary support.**

##### The Jupiter Growth Fund

We're taking that $70M and redirecting it into programs that directly benefit users, builders, and the ecosystem:

**Immediate Impact ($28M)**
1. **Liquidity Mining 2.0** ($15M): Up to 90% APR for LP providers
2. **Trading Rewards** ($8M): Fee rebates + JUP bonuses for active traders
3. **Referral Program** ($5M): Earn JUP for bringing new users

**Ecosystem Expansion ($24.5M)**
4. **Developer Grants** ($10M): Fund 100+ ecosystem projects
5. **Strategic Partnerships** ($7.5M): Integrate with major wallets and protocols
6. **Perpetuals Growth** ($7M): Make Jup Perps #1 on Solana

**Strategic Innovation ($10.5M)**
7. **Mobile App** ($5M): First-class mobile experience
8. **Cross-Chain Expansion** ($3M): Multi-chain aggregation
9. **Research & Development** ($2.5M): Technology leadership

**Strategic Reserve ($7M)**
10. **Flexible Capital** ($7M): Scale winners, seize opportunities

### Press Release

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**Jupiter Exchange Announces $70M Growth Fund to Accelerate Ecosystem Development**

*Leading Solana DEX Redirects Capital from Token Buybacks to High-Impact Growth Programs*

Jupiter Exchange, the leading decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator on Solana, today announced the Jupiter Growth Fund, a $70 million initiative designed to 10x the ecosystem over the next 12-24 months.

The Growth Fund represents a strategic shift from token buybacks—which showed minimal impact despite significant investment—to direct ecosystem growth through user incentives, developer grants, strategic partnerships, and product innovation.

"Buybacks are defensive. Growth is offensive. After spending $70M on buybacks with minimal results, we're taking what we learned and deploying that capital where it actually creates value: growing our user base, supporting builders, and shipping products that people want."

**The $70M Allocation:**

The Growth Fund will deploy capital across 10 programs:
- $28M in immediate-impact user incentives
- $24.5M in ecosystem expansion initiatives
- $10.5M in strategic innovation
- $7M in strategic reserve for opportunistic deployment

All programs include clear success metrics, ROI tracking, and full transparency through a public dashboard.

**Expected Impact:**

Jupiter projects the Growth Fund will deliver:
- 10x increase in daily active users
- 5x increase in daily trading volume
- 5x increase in total value locked
- 100+ new ecosystem projects
- 20+ major integrations

The Growth Fund is subject to DAO approval, with voting open through April 22, 2025.
